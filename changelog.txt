| v1.0.6 Change Log:
| - The DuckDuckGo search was removed because it did not produce results.
| + Added new file-types - 'mdb', 'accdb', 'sqlite', 'psql' for -f search.
| + Added the fake_useragent library for header generation (pip install fake-useragent).
| + Instead of 'requests', there will now be 'aiohttp' lib. This has increased the speed of work!
